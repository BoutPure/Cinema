# Cinema

This project is a part of the Java branch in holygraph of School21.

# Summary

This is a site for movie theater, it will be developed more in next project called Cinema-spring-boot.

In this project we use:
- Spring Controllers
- Hibernate without Spring Data Jpa
- Ajax-requests for live search
- Spring Websockets for chats (every movie has its own chat, since this project has no signIn/signUp functionality each user has its own random name, which is saved in cookies)
- FreeMarker as template engine.
